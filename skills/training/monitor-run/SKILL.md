# Monitor a run

## Runbook

### On launch

1. Find the run dir and read the resolved configs at `{run_dir}/configs/` (start with `rl.json`). The run dir is `{output_dir}/{run_name}` — `run.name` auto-generates as `<envs>--<model>--<short-id>`, so if you only know the output dir, pick the most recently modified subdirectory (`ls -t {output_dir} | head -1`) or read `run.name` from the launch command.
2. Confirm all processes are alive and the run is making progress.
3. Write the initial summary into `{run_dir}/STATUS.md`.

### Recurring check-ins

Default cadence: **1 hour** (researcher can override). At each check-in:

1. Confirm processes are alive.
2. Grep logs for errors/warnings; note current step and key metrics.
3. **Append** an entry to `{run_dir}/STATUS.md` (never overwrite):

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC

**Step**: {current_step} / {max_steps}
**Health**: {Healthy | Degraded | Down}

**Progress**: reward/mean, seq_len, truncation, eval scores, env-specific metrics.
**Stability**: entropy, mismatch_kl, grad_norm — flag spikes.
**Performance**: trainer vs orchestrator step time, env lag, inference pressure.

**Notes**: anything unusual (errors, restarts, hangs). Omit if nothing notable.
```

In W&B, each project auto-gets an **"overview" saved view** (train / eval / stability / performance sections) on its first run — use it for a quick check instead of the auto-generated default workspace.

### Restarting a run

**Never restart unless the researcher explicitly asked.** Confirm the exact restart command and the conditions that warrant one.

**Never** run kill or launch commands from your own shell. Dispatch them to the tmux **Launcher** window so the researcher sees what was executed:

```bash
SESSION=$(tmux display-message -p '#S')
tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION:Launcher" 'your command here' Enter
```

After a restart, verify all processes are back up and progress resumed before the next check-in.

## Reference

### Where to find things

- `scripts/tmux.sh` launches the run with a `Launcher` window in the named tmux session. The Claude window receives the run dir and session name in its appended prompt — if either is missing, **ask** rather than guess.
- `{run_dir}/configs/` — resolved configs, written as JSON so explicit None settings round-trip (`rl.json` has the full picture).
- `{run_dir}/logs/latest/` — the current attempt's logs (each launch gets `logs/attempt_<n>/`; resumes never overwrite earlier attempts). See below.
- `{run_dir}/rollouts/step_N/{train,eval}/` — saved rollout traces (see Traces below).

### Logs

```
{run_dir}/logs/latest/
├── trainer.log                # rank 0 stdout
├── orchestrator.log           # orchestrator stdout
├── evals.log                  # SFT online-eval evals stdout (single-node; the decoupled multi-node eval job logs at {run_dir}/logs/evals.log)
├── inference.log              # vLLM stdout

└── envs/{train,eval}/{env_name}.log    # one log file per env
```

Usually tailing `trainer.log`, `orchestrator.log`, and `inference.log` is enough. Drop into per-node or per-rank logs only when debugging. All logs are loguru with `HH:mm:ss  LEVEL  message`; levels: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `SUCCESS`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`.

Scan for problems:

```bash
grep -E "WARNING|ERROR" {run_dir}/logs/latest/{trainer,orchestrator,evals,inference}.log
grep -E "WARNING|ERROR" {run_dir}/logs/latest/envs/{train,eval}/*.log
```

### Metrics

All metrics print to the console log (and W&B when configured).

**Progress** — orchestrator log. Rollout metrics mirror the episode/trace hierarchy, at two levels:

- `{scope}/{subset}/<metric>/<stat>` — episode-level facts only: the token/turn/branch counts, summed over an episode's traces.
- `{scope}/{subset}/<agent>/<metric>/<stat>` — every trace-level metric (reward, truncation, errors, timing, env metrics, curriculum admission, eval scores), keyed by agent name so seats never mix. Flat over that agent's traces: one sample is one trace, so an in-episode fan-out like n solvers contributes n samples.

`scope` is `train/agg` (all train envs) or `train/<env>` (`eval/<env>` for eval); `subset` is `all` (every rollout) or `effective` (admitted, clean, and trainable). Single-agent envs have one agent — usually `agent` — and one trace per episode, so both levels agree; multi-agent envs name each seat (`proposer`, `solver`, `judge`, …).

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `train/agg/effective/<agent>/reward/mean` | mean training reward for that agent (per env: `train/<env>/effective/<agent>/reward/mean`) |
| `train/agg/effective/num_total_tokens/mean` | avg tokens per episode, summed over its agents (also `num_input_tokens`, `num_output_tokens`) |
| `train/agg/effective/num_turns/mean` | avg turns per episode, summed over its agents |
| `train/<env>/effective/<agent>/num_turns/mean` | avg turns for that agent alone (also token counts, `num_branches`) |
| `train/agg/effective/<agent>/is_truncated/mean` | fraction of that agent's rollouts truncated |
| `train/agg/all/<agent>/has_error/mean` | fraction of that agent's rollouts errored (per-type under `train/agg/all/<agent>/error/<type>`; also `dispatcher/errored/{train,eval}`) |
| `train/agg/all/<agent>/is_trainable/mean` | fraction carrying a training signal — 0.0 for a frozen seat like a judge |
| `train/agg/all/<agent>/is_admitted/mean` | fraction accepted by the source curriculum; per-source counters and custom policy metrics live under `curriculum/<env>/` |
| `train/<env>/effective/<agent>/metrics/<name>/mean` | env-specific metrics for that agent (e.g. pass rate) |
| `train/<env>/effective/<agent>/timing/agent/model/mean` | model vs harness share of that agent's phase |
| `eval/<env>/effective/<agent>/{avg@k,pass@k}` | eval scores for that agent, when configured |

**Stability** — trainer log:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `mismatch_kl/{all,env}/{mean,std,max}` | KL between trainer and (old) inference policy over trainable tokens |
| `entropy/{all,env}/{mean,std,max}` | policy entropy over trainable tokens |
| `masked_advantage_{positive,negative}/mean` | fraction of DPPO-masked tokens with +/- advantage |
| `optim/grad_norm` | spikes may precede divergence |

**Performance** — trainer and orchestrator step independently, so comparing step times shows who's waiting on whom.

| Source | Metric | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| trainer | `time/step` | total trainer step |
| trainer | `time/wait_for_batch` | **high → orchestrator is bottleneck** |
| trainer | `time/forward_backward`, `time/broadcast_weights`, `time/save_ckpt` | phase timings |
| trainer | `perf/throughput`, `perf/mfu` | tokens/s and MFU % |
| orchestrator | `time/step`, `time/save_ckpt` | phase timings |
| orchestrator | `time/wait_for_policy` | **high → trainer is bottleneck** |
| orchestrator | `dispatcher/off_policy_level/{mean,max}`, `dispatcher/inflight/{train,eval}`, `dispatcher/queued/eval` | dispatcher / async state |
| env server | event loop lag (min/mean/p90/p99/max), active task distribution | periodic |

For live vLLM stats, query Prometheus directly:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8100/metrics | grep -E "num_requests|gpu_cache_usage"  # engine port (8000 is the router)
# vllm:num_requests_running, vllm:num_requests_waiting, vllm:gpu_cache_usage_perc (→1.0 = KV cache saturated)
```

### Traces

```
{run_dir}/rollouts/step_N/{train,eval}/all/traces.jsonl        # appended per rollout as it completes
{run_dir}/rollouts/step_N/{train,eval}/effective/traces.jsonl  # written per finalized batch / eval epoch
```

JSONL files of `vf.Trace` records (training tensors excluded), one line per trace — a
multi-agent env's episode contributes several lines sharing one `info.episode_id`. `all`
gets every completed rollout the moment it arrives — errored, curriculum-rejected, and never-batched
ones included — so it's crash-durable; `effective` gets the clean trainable subset that went
into the step's train batch (eval: the non-errored trainable epoch cohort; multiple eval envs
share the step file) — untrainable traces (a frozen judge's) appear only in `all`. Each record carries `run` (`{type, id, step}`; for eval, `step` is the trigger step),
`verifiers` (producing build), `agent` (model, sampling, harness, `name`, `trainable`), `ok`
(the success sentinel — `errors` alone keeps retry history even after a recovery), and
`runtime` (config + provisioned resource id, e.g. the sandbox id), plus `env_name`,
`group_id`, `episode_id`, and `policy_version` under `info`.

```bash
wc -l {run_dir}/rollouts/step_42/train/{all,effective}/traces.jsonl
jq '.rewards' {run_dir}/rollouts/step_42/train/effective/traces.jsonl
jq 'select(.ok | not) | {id, env: .info.env_name, runtime}' {run_dir}/rollouts/step_*/train/all/traces.jsonl
```

The batches consumed by the trainer are shipped over ZMQ by default, so nothing binary is written. With `rollout_transport.type = "filesystem"` they land at `{run_dir}/rollouts/step_N/rank_<rank>.bin` (one packed micro-batch file per trainer DP rank), next to the trace subtrees.

### Common failure modes

A few warnings are normal. Escalate when errors are persistent, growing, or hit a large fraction of rollouts.

- **Env workers**: exceptions in env code, timeouts, sandbox errors, OOM kills (most common source — runs user code).
- **Orchestrator**: empty/errored rollout spikes, weight-broadcast failures, checkpoint errors.
- **Trainer**: NCCL/CUDA errors, OOM, NaN loss or gradients.
- **Inference**: NCCL/CUDA errors, OOM, request timeouts.

### Process tree

All processes use `setproctitle` so they're visible in `ps`/`htop`/`pstree`:

```
PRIME-RL::Launcher
├── PRIME-RL::Inference          (vLLM server, GPU 0)
├── PRIME-RL::EnvServer          (verifiers' ZMQ env server, run in-process; one per train/eval source)
│   └── Verifiers::EnvWorker0..N
├── PRIME-RL::Orchestrator       (CPU-only; connects to each env server)
├── torchrun
│   └── PRIME-RL::Trainer        (GPU 1+)
└── tail trainer.log
```

For multi-node runs, trainer and inference processes are on separate nodes — use `srun` or `ssh` to inspect them.
